Upstream
===================
Currently, RPC is the transimission method bewteen MSP and backend server. 
But we use RPC here is ONLY for convience, because the FAE has the stack now.
IMO, I prefer ZMQ.


Bussiness
==========
- Mobile Client request:
  - msp receive the mcp request, pack it to rpc request, send it to the backend service
  - after backend receive request, give the rpc reponse IMMEDIATELY
  - handle the rpc request ONLY the rpc result is error, which means send failure
  - the mcp response will be received as another rpc request
- Server Request:
  - msp receive the rpc request, pack it to mcp format
  - msp send the rpc response IMMEDIATELY, 
  - then send the mcp request 
  - After the Moblie-Client send the response, the msp pack the mcp reponse to a new rpc request
  - send the request to the backend service


Models
======
- rpc_server
  - server informations : adress,port,config, stats, perf_counters ..
  - connection informations : use for maintain all the client connections
- rpc_client
  - client informations : stats, config, perf_counters .. 
  - upstream-map : KV mapping for address-rpc_connection structure
- upstreamer_root
  - RB_ROOT
  - upstream map
  - connecting_connection_list 
- upstreamer 
  - connection_list
  - to_send_queue : save the request when the connection is not ready to go with
  -
- rpc_connection
  - connection information : fd, ev, sock_addr, connnecting_time duration_time .. 
  - buffer
  - last seq number
  - request-map (transaction map) , only used in client side, because the server side will process the request one by one so we don't need to maintain the request-map 
  - upstream list_head: each upstream has multiple connection
  - connection status : disconnected, connecting, connected
  - 
- rpc_request
- rpc_response
